#'  Tidewater Goby Detection Data
#'
#'  A data set containing detections and non-detections of tidewater goby DNA in water samples collected at each of 39 sites located along 400 km of coastline in California and Oregon, USA.  At each site, water samples were collected to extract the DNA of the tidewater goby  (\emph{Eucyclogbobius newberryi}), a federally endangered fish species living in estuaries, lagoons, and sloughs.
