\description{
A data set containing environmental and ecological variables measured at each of 39 sites located along 400 km of coastline in California and Oregon, USA.  At each site, water samples were collected to extract the DNA of the tidewater goby  (\emph{Eucyclogbobius newberryi}), a federally endangered fish species living in estuaries, lagoons, and sloughs.
